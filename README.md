This is a HOWTO and scripts for turning a RaspberryPi 2/3/4 into a Cyber Range In A Box (RIAB).. or, a portable, headless, penetration box that can both function as an autonomous sniffer, or as a WiFi to Ethernet NAT firewall, which you can use from either your terminal or via Remote Desktop, either over WiFi or secure, wired connection.
